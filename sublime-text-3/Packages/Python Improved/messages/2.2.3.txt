Python Improved v2.2.3
======================

The `meta.identifier.python` scope was messing up some stuff (see #70), and I
can't really remember what its original function was supposed to be, so I
commented it out. If I ever remember or if someone could remind me, maybe I'll
try to fix it and put it back in. Maybe.
